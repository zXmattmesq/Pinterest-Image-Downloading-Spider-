My Changes, Matt Viana:

Built a Pinterest spider using notable tools like Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, and ThreadPoolExecutor to efficiently scrape images and comments based on search terms.

Improved upon Atul Kumar Singh's pinscrape by creating the PinterestSpider class, enabling mass image downloads from Pinterest while leveraging proxy rotation and other security measures.

Integrated a system to validate and test a list of proxies, saving only the formatted working ones for consistent scraping.

Automated the process by reading search terms from a text file and iterating through them to download images and comments.
